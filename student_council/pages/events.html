This is why the National Intellectual Property Awareness Mission (NIPAM), operating under the Indian Government's "Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav" initiative, is playing a significant role in promoting IP awareness among students throughout India.
                                    <br><br>Dr. Suraj Bhoyar recently conducted a National Workshop on IPR & IP Management for Start-ups under the auspices of NIPAM, which was very successful. The workshop aimed to educate students about the importance of intellectual property rights and how startups can safeguard their innovations, creations, and ideas through patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other types of intellectual property rights. Attendees learned about the basics of IP management, licensing, and commercialization. The participants also pledged to serve as IP ambassadors across the campus and raise awareness about the importance of intellectual property.
                                    <br><br>Overall, the National Workshop on IPR & IP Management for Start-ups was a vital initiative conducted under the auspices of NIPAM, which aims to promote innovation and creativity among students throughout India. We hope that such initiatives will continue to be organized, and students will take full advantage of them to create a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the nation.

The festival takes place in August or September, depending on the lunar calendar, and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and devotion.
                                    <br><br>Temples witness a surge in devotees who engage in bhajans (devotional songs) and prayers throughout the day and night. The midnight hour, believed to be the time of Lord Krishna's birth, is particularly significant. Temples resound with the singing of hymns and the air is thick with the fragrance of incense. Traditional dances, dramas, and processions add a cultural flair to the celebrations. Devotees dress up as characters from Krishna's life, with vibrant costumes and elaborate props, narrating stories from the divine tale of the deity. Folk performances and devotional plays, known as 'Rasa Lila,' depict the various stages of Krishna's life, captivating audiences and instilling a sense of spiritual ecstasy. Feasting plays a vital role in Janmashtami celebrations, with devotees preparing special dishes that are offered to the deity and later distributed as prasad. Sweets, particularly those made with butter, are a highlight, paying homage to Lord Krishna's love for butter during his childhood.
                                    <br><br>Janmashtami transcends religious boundaries and unites people in the celebration of divine love, spirituality, and joy. The festival serves as a reminder of the timeless teachings of Lord Krishna encapsulated in the Bhagavad Gita, promoting righteousness, devotion, and the path of dharma. Janmashtami is a kaleidoscope of colors, rituals, and devotion that brings communities together in reverence for the beloved Lord Krishna.

                                    their significance during graduation. Participants learned how these courses can
                                    enhance their learning experience and boost their career prospects by providing
                                    access to high-quality educational resources.



                                    <br><br>Dr. Bhoyar emphasized the importance of continuous learning and
                                    innovation in his address, urging students to take full advantage of the
                                    opportunities presented to them. "Our goal is to equip our students with the
                                    tools and knowledge they need to succeed and to inspire them to reach new
                                    heights in their careers and personal lives," he said.

                                    The Career Catalyst Workshop was a resounding success, leaving students
                                    motivated and better prepared to tackle their future challenges. MIT ADT
                                    University remains committed to creating a vibrant and supportive environment

                                    successful implementation of its Green Campus Initiative, in alignment with the
                                    Government of India’s Fit India Movement. This progressive program is designed
                                    to promote health, environmental stewardship, and sustainable transportation
                                    within the student community.
                                    Central to this initiative is the introduction of a fleet of smart bicycles in
                                    collaboration with MYBYK. These bicycles offer students an affordable and
                                    eco-friendly transportation option on campus. Accessible through an online
                                    application, the smart bicycles can be rented on a daily, weekly, monthly, or
                                    yearly basis, providing flexible and convenient access for all students.

                                    <br><br>This initiative aims to significantly reduce the use of conventional
                                    vehicles, promoting health and fitness among students. To support this
                                    sustainable transportation model, the campus has installed Hexi ports and
                                    enhanced cycle tracks, ensuring a seamless riding experience.
                                    MIT ADT University Green Campus Initiative benefits over 10,000 students by
                                    providing a healthy and sustainable transportation option. The initiative not
                                    only enhances physical fitness but also contributes to a cleaner environment,
                                    embodying a holistic approach to student well-being.

                                    <br><br>The impact on the student community is significant. By integrating
                                    physical activity into daily routines, students are expected to experience
                                    improved health and fitness, potentially boosting their academic performance and
                                    overall quality of life. Additionally, the emphasis on sustainability and
                                    environmental care instils a sense of responsibility and global citizenship
                                    among students.

                                    physical fitness and intellectual sharpness of our student community. The session,

                                    culture in the upcoming academic year.

                                    August 2024 at MIT ADT University was a thoughtfully organized event designed to
                                    warmly welcome new students and their families to the university. The program aimed
                                    to introduce the attendees to the campus, faculty, and the university's vibrant
                                    culture. As a part of this initiative, the university arranged for food packets to
                                    ensure the comfort and convenience of all participants.

                                    <br>On the first day, 4,000 food packets were prepared, but it was observed that
                                    approximately 500 food packets remained unclaimed. To optimize resources, the order
                                    was reduced to 3,500 packets for the following day, but still, 475 packets were left
                                    unclaimed. Understanding the importance of reducing food wastage and promoting
                                    social responsibility, the Vice Chancellor of MIT ADT University, Dr. Mangesh T.
                                    Karad, and the Associate Director of Student Affairs, Dr. Suraj Bhoyar, made a
                                    commendable decision to donate these surplus food packets.
                                    In alignment with the university's ethos of community engagement, the unclaimed food
                                    packets were distributed to the underprivileged through the Robin Hood Army, a local
                                    volunteering organization dedicated to fighting hunger. The food was promptly
                                    delivered within an hour of the Induction Program's conclusion, ensuring that it
                                    reached those in need while still fresh.



                                    <br><br>This initiative reflects MIT ADT University's strong commitment to social
                                    responsibility and community welfare, echoing the broader objectives of The Indian
                                    Food Sharing Alliance (IFSA) by bridging the gap between surplus food and those who
                                    need it most. The university extends heartfelt gratitude to Shri. Sawant from Robin
                                    Hood Army for his cooperation and swift action in making this distribution possible.

                                    diligent efforts in ensuring the success of this initiative.

                                    demonstrate
                                    their unique contributions to the university.
                                    Dr. Bhoyar also provided an insightful overview of the induction program for new
                                    members. He stressed the need for well-planned orientation programs and training
                                    sessions to ensure that new members are seamlessly integrated into the club's
                                    activities. The induction program aims to equip new members with the necessary
                                    skills
                                    and knowledge to actively participate and contribute to their respective clubs.

                                    <br><br>The meeting concluded with an open forum where club leaders shared their
                                    ideas,
                                    asked questions, and engaged in a collaborative discussion. Dr. Bhoyar's guidance
                                    and
                                    the collective enthusiasm of the club leaders set a positive tone for the year
                                    ahead.
                                    In summary, the Student Club Orientation meeting was a resounding success, thanks to
                                    Dr.
                                    Suraj Bhoyar's inspiring leadership. The session equipped the club leaders with the
                                    knowledge, motivation, and strategic direction needed to make the academic year
                                    2024-25
                                    a period of growth, innovation, and success for the student clubs at MIT ADT
                                    University.
