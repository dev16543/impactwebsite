This is why the National Intellectual Property Awareness Mission (NIPAM), operating under the Indian Government's "Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav" initiative, is playing a significant role in promoting IP awareness among students throughout India.
                                    <br><br>Dr. Suraj Bhoyar recently conducted a National Workshop on IPR & IP Management for Start-ups under the auspices of NIPAM, which was very successful. The workshop aimed to educate students about the importance of intellectual property rights and how startups can safeguard their innovations, creations, and ideas through patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other types of intellectual property rights. Attendees learned about the basics of IP management, licensing, and commercialization. The participants also pledged to serve as IP ambassadors across the campus and raise awareness about the importance of intellectual property.
                                    <br><br>Overall, the National Workshop on IPR & IP Management for Start-ups was a vital initiative conducted under the auspices of NIPAM, which aims to promote innovation and creativity among students throughout India. We hope that such initiatives will continue to be organized, and students will take full advantage of them to create a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the nation.

The festival takes place in August or September, depending on the lunar calendar, and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and devotion.
                                    <br><br>Temples witness a surge in devotees who engage in bhajans (devotional songs) and prayers throughout the day and night. The midnight hour, believed to be the time of Lord Krishna's birth, is particularly significant. Temples resound with the singing of hymns and the air is thick with the fragrance of incense. Traditional dances, dramas, and processions add a cultural flair to the celebrations. Devotees dress up as characters from Krishna's life, with vibrant costumes and elaborate props, narrating stories from the divine tale of the deity. Folk performances and devotional plays, known as 'Rasa Lila,' depict the various stages of Krishna's life, captivating audiences and instilling a sense of spiritual ecstasy. Feasting plays a vital role in Janmashtami celebrations, with devotees preparing special dishes that are offered to the deity and later distributed as prasad. Sweets, particularly those made with butter, are a highlight, paying homage to Lord Krishna's love for butter during his childhood.
                                    <br><br>Janmashtami transcends religious boundaries and unites people in the celebration of divine love, spirituality, and joy. The festival serves as a reminder of the timeless teachings of Lord Krishna encapsulated in the Bhagavad Gita, promoting righteousness, devotion, and the path of dharma. Janmashtami is a kaleidoscope of colors, rituals, and devotion that brings communities together in reverence for the beloved Lord Krishna.

The team visited a local polling station to interview citizens and gather insights about their views on the election process and voting system. This initiative aimed to raise awareness and motivate people to actively participate in the upcoming elections.
                                        The team conducted a series of interviews with various citizens, from first-time voters to experienced members of the community, gaining valuable perspectives on the importance of voting and the election system. The citizens expressed their views on the accessibility of the voting process, the ease of understanding candidates, and the role of education in making informed voting decisions. Most respondents emphasized the need for greater transparency and the importance of casting a vote as a civic duty, encouraging others to be part of the democratic process.
                                        One of the most significant interviews was with the local Sarpanch and Upa Sarpanch. Both leaders highlighted the vital role of elections in shaping local governance and improving the overall quality of life in the community. The Sarpanch spoke passionately about how local elections directly impact infrastructure development, public services, and education, while the Upa Sarpanch stressed the importance of voter participation in strengthening democracy. They also discussed the various challenges faced in encouraging citizens, especially younger voters, to take part in the elections.
                                        In addition to the interviews, the team also used the opportunity to educate the public on the election process, providing information on how to register to vote, the importance of voter IDs, and how the election system works. They encouraged citizens to make their voices heard by voting and underscored that every vote matters in shaping the future of the nation.

This progressive program is designed to promote health, environmental stewardship, and sustainable transportation within the student community.
                                        Central to this initiative is the introduction of a fleet of smart bicycles in collaboration with MYBYK. These bicycles offer students an affordable and eco-friendly transportation option on campus. Accessible through an online application, the smart bicycles can be rented on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, providing flexible and convenient access for all students.
                                        Equipped with advanced features including inbuilt GPS tracking for safety, smart lock systems, adjustable saddles, sturdy baskets, and puncture-proof tyres, these bicycles are designed for both convenience and durability. Students can easily unlock their bicycles using a smart QR code system, with nominal payments processed through digital wallets.
                                        This initiative aims to significantly reduce the use of conventional vehicles, promoting health and fitness among students. To support this sustainable transportation model, the campus has installed Hexi ports and enhanced cycle tracks, ensuring a seamless riding experience.
                                        MIT ADT University Green Campus Initiative benefits over 10,000 students by providing a healthy and sustainable transportation option. The initiative not only enhances physical fitness but also contributes to a cleaner environment, embodying a holistic approach to student well-being.
                                        The impact on the student community is significant. By integrating physical activity into daily routines, students are expected to experience improved health and fitness, potentially boosting their academic performance and overall quality of life.

                                        The 'Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyan' trekking campaign is a significant step towards a healthier and drug-free society, aligning with the national goals of progress and well-being. The Office of Student Affairs at MIT ADT University aims to continue organizing such events and engage the youth in meaningful endeavours for the betterment of society.

We spent the afternoon playing games like passing the ball and lagori, filling the space with laughter and smiles. The connection we built with the children through these simple joys was perhaps the most memorable part of our day. We could feel a sense of companionship, bridging us across generations and backgrounds.
                                        The donation drive was a heartwarming success, showcasing our college community’s compassion. We received a generous response of clothing, stationery, bags, and treats from students, staff, and faculty. Special thanks to Aditi, Aditya, and ACES for their contributions of snacks and staples.Our visit to APLA GHAR was memorable, as we connected with children and the elderly as well as this drive fostered unity on campus and inspired us to continue making a difference, strengthening our bonds and laying the groundwork for future initiatives. We are grateful for the opportunity to uplift those around us.
